          content: 'This is definitely not a movie that I would have chosen to watch all by myself which perhaps explain why I thought it was just surprisingly okay to watch. However my girlfriend absolutely wanted to watch it so I got it. As it turned out my girlfriend had only gone by the number of Oscars and not really looked up what kind of movie it actually was so in the end I was enjoying the movie a lot more than she did.\r\n\r\nThis movie is pretty much a quite classical Hollywood musical with a non too original story, nice music and dancing. In addition the cinematography  is simply excellent. This is the strong point of this movie. The rest of the movie is of lesser interest to me but the cinematography is really, really good. The scene, pictured on the movie poster, were Mia and Sebastian dances and everything in the scene are dark blue tones except Mia’s bright yellow dress is so simple and yet so beautiful.\r\n\r\nEverything else about this movie is…okay. Okay acting, okay story etc.  As I wrote before this is really not my kind of movie so forgive me for not being overly enthusiastic. I am sure those into these kind of movies cannot understand how anyone can give it less than a full set of stars but hey, different tastes and all that.\r\n\r\nI cannot make up my mind about ending. On one hand I am a sucker for happy endings which this one falls a wee bit short on. On the other hand I have to commend the writer/director for not taking the path of least resistance and instead putting together something a wee bit different.\r\n\r\nI did feel that a part of the movie was missing though. I would have liked to see the parts where Mia and Sebastian actually fulfilled their respective dreams. Jumping fast forward to the ending like the movie did felt a bit like they either ran out of money or they manage to misplace half the story!\r\n\r\nAnyway, I enjoyed the movie more than I thought I would.',

          content: '**They\'d crossed each others life while chasing their dreams.**\r\n\r\nI am not a big fan of modern musical films. So I was not expecting it to be a great or worst. The film opened with a song that I was not happy, because I did not like the verse or the music. And again to say, the modern timeline does not suit for the musical theme, unless it is a fantasy or an Indian film. \r\n\r\nThe best part of the film was, those song fades away as the film progresses. But I kind of liked the drama/story part and the climax track with the quick flashback (kind of). Till that scene I was considering it an average film, but that one scene changed my stance. So, now I think it is a good film, but winning 6 Oscars, I don\'t know it deserved that.\r\n\r\nYes, the director is known for making music and musical film, but he has not made many. He\'s young and so his career. Yep, I loved \'Whiplash\'. One of my all time favourite. If that film had won 10 Oscars, I would have not surprised at all. After that flick, the people were anticipating, to exceed that success in this film. As it was received, no doubt for those people it was a different flick, but not for me. Especially if you watch lots of Indian films. By the way the film characters were nice, and so the story, but not the songs.\r\n\r\nGosling and Stone were performed well. The chemistry between them was great. The narration was going decently until the end, which reminded me \'Vinnaithaandi Varuvaaya\' ending that I was not happy about, yet something different than usual. Sometimes I am okay with cliché than this kind of conclusion, just to bring a change in storytelling. Overall an enjoyable film, most people would love it. Some like me would say it is a decent flick, but there\'s always a few who would never favour it. Yet worth a watch.\r\n\r\n_7/10_',

          content: 'If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nI love war movies, especially when they\'re able to depict the action in such an immersive way that the viewers really feel like they\'re there. In my opinion, it\'s the genre that most requires a technically outstanding production quality. The visual effects need to be absolutely perfect. The cinematography must capture the intensity of the battlefield. The sound design has to be incredibly powerful. Finally, a war film requires the most epic, nail-biting, chill-inducing score so the audience can actually feel the unbelievable atmosphere that this genre usually possesses. Greyhound has one of the greatest actors of all-time as its protagonist, but does it check the points mentioned above?\r\n\r\nYes and no. Technically, this movie barely has any issues. The VFX look utterly stunning, no doubt about it. Shelly Jackson, the cinematographer, has one of the most challenging tasks a filmmaker can have: filming in a water environment. He deals with this problem surprisingly well, by allowing the viewers to fully understand everything that\'s going on for the entire runtime. The score (Blake Neely) is emotionally powerful, but I believe it could have elevated a lot more action sequences than it actually does. The editing (Mark Czyzewski, Sidney Wolinsky) is excellent as well.\r\n\r\nSo, what failed? Well, I will always defend that the two pillars of any film are its story and characters. Without one of these two, very few movies can survive. Without the two, no film can. I have to use Dunkirk as an example here. Christopher Nolan spent the whole marketing campaign saying that his movie was about the depiction of an actual war. About how it felt to actually be in one. Therefore, Dunkirk barely has any sort of character development… because not only it never intended to, but it doesn\'t need it to accomplish its goal. \r\n\r\nHowever, its storytelling follows a distinct method that allows for some exhilarating moments in the air, ground, and sea. Its action sequences are so powerful and incredibly realistic that I consider it the most immersive war experience I have ever experienced. Thus, the lack of compelling characters didn\'t really bother me because I was there to try to feel what it\'s like to be in a war. Greyhound also doesn\'t have one single character who\'s well-developed or well-explored. They all seem to have names, and that\'s it. Tom Hanks is obviously impressive in his acting role…\r\n\r\nBut his skills as a screenwriter definitely need to improve. Like I insinuate above, there\'s no problem in having depthless characters, as long as the story and, in this case, the action, work. None do. I\'m not lying when I write that 90%+ of the script is Hanks yelling "turn right", "hard left", "slow down", and hundreds of other types of direction guidelines in nautical language. The action is lackluster. Basically, the whole film is a repetitive, tiresome cycle of a U-boat showing up on the radar, Hanks looking through several windows shouting the same nautical stuff to his crew, and trying to eliminate the enemy\'s ships.\r\n\r\nI could feel the suspense and the tension that Hanks\' ship emanated. I love the first encounter and pursuit of the first U-boat, it\'s exceptionally filmed and quite riveting. But from this moment on, it\'s just the same sequence stuck on repeat mode until no more ships exist. So, even though the set pieces look marvelous, these scenes quickly lose impact. Aaron Schneider should have found a way of elevating Hanks\' screenplay, but unfortunately, he can only do so much. By the end, I\'m left with a character whose name I can barely remember (honestly, I needed two full minutes to remember the protagonist\'s name after the movie ended).\r\n\r\nAll in all, Greyhound could have easily ended up as a small-scale Dunkirk. Technically, it has everything it needs to be a brilliant war flick: beautiful visual effects, powerful sound design, impeccable cinematography, and an epic score. Disregarding one of the two pillars of filmmaking (story and characters) is only an issue if the other also doesn\'t work. The lack of any character development can be perfectly compensated in a war film, as long as the method of storytelling allows for a unique experience packed with realistic and immersive action. However, Aaron Schneider\'s movie doesn\'t possess a compelling story, and the action set pieces are stuck in a dull cycle of hunting U-boats in the exact same way throughout the whole film. The first sequence is packed with tension and suspense, but from that moment on, the entertainment levels drop drastically. Tom Hanks is fantastic as the protagonist, but his screenplay is far from truly being one. All dialogues revolve around characters (mostly Hanks\'s) calling nautical instructions for most of the runtime and looking either through a window or binoculars. In the end, it\'s underwhelming and disappointing, but I still recommend it to the war genre\'s aficionados.\r\n\r\nRating: C',

          content: 'Greyhound is watchable but entirely fanciful.\r\n\r\nTom Hanks is a Captain of a destroyer taking on the u-boat menace. He\'s fearless, god fearing, modest and faces down hordes of u-boats who are out to get him. \r\n\r\nThe enemy goads him, sends u-boats to face off with destroyers in 18th century style exchanges and sails around on the surface  following his floatilla, in open defiance. \r\n\r\n\r\nNow for an injection of reality. U-boats did not take on destroyers in surface battles of the kind you see in this film. They did not goad their captains (and records show they took no pleasure in the job they did) nor did they let the destroyer know they were there. This is a fiction and a rather silly one at that. U-boats were not a match for a destroyer, in any sense and made every effort to evade them. \r\n\r\nThe US in the early days of this war, were hopelessly outclassed by u-boat packs. It took considerable time before they started defending merchant shipping. Their admirality mostly declined advice and help from their more experienced, British counterparts. This predictably made  the situation a lot worse. Eventually they did catch up but only after suffering massive losses. \r\n\r\nThis film is, in short, a fiction. Its entertaining, its well acted, I do like Tom Hanks and the action scenes whilst in many instances ridiculous, are well rendered and frenetic. \r\n\r\nSo by all means watch Greyhound for pure entertainment but don\'t expect a "Das Boot" experience by any means. Its worth mentioning too that even Das Boot was not 100% correct but a lot closer to the truth than this film could ever hope to be. \r\n\r\n6/10.',

          content: 'If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nI was never the biggest fan of Scooby-Doo\'s animated cartoon when I was young. I enjoyed it like any other kid who enjoys almost everything, but it was never a show that made me nervously excited during the day, waiting for it to come on TV. I vividly remember getting pumped, knowing that a new episode of Dragon Ball Z or Timon & Pumba would broadcast on that particular day. I never felt that way with Scooby-Doo, and honestly, I don\'t know why. I was always curious about sci-fi and "what lies beyond", so maybe the fact that the goal of the show was to justify every single paranormal activity with some "guy in a mask" didn\'t really appeal to the kid in me...\r\n\r\nEither way, I still liked the series, and my memory is filled with all of the show\'s classic signatures: the (double or even triple) un-masking of the villains, Scooby jumping to Shaggy\'s arms because they both got scared, the ridiculously large sandwiches, you name it. Ironically, the biggest compliment I can give the film also relates to its major flaw. For any fan of the show, these classic moments will provide high levels of nostalgia and entertainment, so anyone who comes looking for that will definitely get what they desire.\r\n\r\nHowever, even though Scoob! is far from feeling like a corporate flick packed with product placement (looking at you, Sonic the Hedgehog), I can\'t help but feel that the studio was embarrassed by its own property. They try so hard to make this movie belong to 2020 that they completely forgot about what makes the show special for so many people. From the weirdly confusing song selection to the way too modern plot points, Scoob! \'s narrative distinctly follows an Avengers-style plot (including an obvious allusion to Captain America holding his shield) focusing strongly on the superhero theme.\r\n\r\nThey didn\'t believe that Mystery Inc. and the (successful) formulaic story were enough to hold the target audience\'s attention, so they decided to borrow from one of the most entertaining and financially impactful genres of today, losing the essence of their own IP. Therefore, despite Scoob! having almost all of the cartoon\'s classic scenes, it still feels detached from the source material. In addition to this, if you\'re not a fan of Scooby-Doo and if you don\'t know anything about it, then don\'t expect this film to explain anything to you.\r\n\r\nFred, Velma, and Daphne get separated from Shaggy and Scooby early on (due to a hilariously dumb scene that only kids will accept), so almost no character development occurs within the first group of people. This movie focuses more on the pair\'s adventure and their relationship dynamics (which are explored in a cliche yet efficient manner), leaving 3/5 of the Mystery Inc. feeling left off. Actually, now that I think about it, Scoob! doesn\'t even have a mystery to solve!\r\n\r\nIn the cartoons, every episode is about discovering what or who\'s causing a specific paranormal event. This film basically follows that formula for the first fifteen minutes (which serve as an origin story of the gang) and then takes an entirely different path story-wise. I\'m not going to complain about the plot\'s absurdity because it\'s undeniably a kids\' movie, but these forced attempts to adapt Scooby-Doo to 2020 are what ruin the whole thing for me. The voice acting is great, though, and hearing Frank Welker interpret Scooby again is incredibly joyful.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Scoob! possesses almost all of the classic moments from the original cartoon, which will surely leave fans of the series satisfied and feeling that heartwarming nostalgia. In addition to this, the voice work is really good for the most part, especially from the legend, Frank Welker as Scooby. However, the studio hurts the film with countless attempts to adapt the formulaic yet successful screenplay that the show employed for decades into 2020. From the superhero-like plot to the lack of a central mystery, Tony Cervone finds himself in a writing mess (four screenwriters and three "story by" credits) from a company ashamed of its own product. If you\'re a hardcore fan of the animated show, this movie might leave you satisfied. But if you don\'t share a special connection with these characters and their classic adventures, or if you don\'t know anything about this franchise at all, Scoob! not only doesn\'t care to introduce or develop its characters, but it definitely isn\'t going to convert you.\r\n\r\nRating: C-',

However, wasn\'t that thrilled with Will Forte\'s Shaggy (still think Matthew Lillard has been perfect thus far, I know they wanted a name, but doubt star power sells movies nowadays).\r\n\r\nAnyway, it was a serviceable enough animated flick, personally I\'m not a fan of the supernatural plots when it comes to the Scooby-Doo franchise, but fine for the family, so long as you\'re not an entrenched fan, I can see why some may hate this iteration. **3.25/5**',

That\'s how I\'d describe the enormously successful series, Supernatural. \r\n\r\nThis is not one to test the synapses but more a lightweight but entertaining monster mash up. The hero\'s of the piece Sam and Dean Winchester are kick ass hunters who track down and kill  monsters and various other supernatural nasties. \r\n\r\nThis series sounds formulaic and indeed it is but it manages to be creative enough with its stories, introducing new plot lines and characters to keep things reasonably fresh. No small feat after 14 seasons.\r\n\r\nOne to enjoy with a beer or two and some chips. 8/10 from me.',
